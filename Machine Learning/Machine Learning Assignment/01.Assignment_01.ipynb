    "##### 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "**Ans:** Machine learning Popularly known as ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values."

    "##### 2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The following are some of the issues where Machine Learning can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Image Recognition`**: Image recognition is one of the most common applications of machine learning. It is used to identify objects, persons, places, digital images, etc. The popular use case of image recognition and face detection is **`Automatic friend tagging suggestion`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Speech Recognition`**: While using Google, we get an option of **`Search by voice`**, it comes under speech recognition, and it's a popular application of Machine Learning. Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions  into text, and it is also known as **`Speech to text`**, or **`Computer based speech recognition`** At present, machine learning algorithms are widely used by various applications of speech recognition. Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are using speech recognition technology to follow the voice instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Traffic prediction`**: It predicts the traffic conditions such as whether traffic is cleared, slow-moving, or heavily congested with the help of two ways: Real Time location of the vehicle form Google Map app and sensors Average time has taken on past days at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`Product recommendations`**: Machine learning is widely used by various e-commerce and entertainment companies such as Amazon, Netflix, etc., for product recommendation to the user."

    "##### 3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "**Ans:** You split up the data containing known response variable values into two pieces. The training set is used to train the algorithm, and then you use the trained model on the test set to predict the response variable values that are already known."
